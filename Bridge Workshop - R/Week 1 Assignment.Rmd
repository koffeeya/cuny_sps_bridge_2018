```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. Write a loop that calculates 12-factorial.

```{r}

x <- 1

for (i in 1:12) {
    x <- x*((1:12)[i])
}

print(x)

```

2. Show how to create a numeric vector that contains the sequence from 20 to 50 by 5.



3. Create the function "factorial" that takes a trio of input numbers a, b, and c and solve the quadratic equation. The function should print as output the two solutions.

```{r}

factorial <- function(a, b, c) {
  if (sqrt(b^2-(4*a*c)) > 0) {
    x_1 <- (-b+(sqrt(b^2-(4*a*c)))/(2*a))
    x_2 <- (-b-(sqrt(b^2-(4*a*c)))/(2*a))
    result <- c(x_1, x_2)
    print(result)
  }
  
  else if (sqrt(b^2-(4*a*c)) == 0) {
    result = -b/(2*a)
    print(result)
  }
  
  else {
    print("No real roots")
  }
}

factorial(1,2,3)


```
