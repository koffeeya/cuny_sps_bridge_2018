```

## 1. Create a vector that contains 20 numbers.
```{r}

x <- as.numeric(c(31, 13, 19, 25, 6, 20, 5, 14, 44, 7, 26, 38, 25, 37, 20, 30, 14, 35, 5))

```


## 2. Use R to convert the vector from question 1 into a character vector.
```{r}

y <- as.character(x)
print(y)

```


3. Use R to convert the vector from question 1 into a vector of factors.
```{r}

f <- factor(x)
print(f)

```


4. Use R to show how many levels the vector in the previous question has.
```{r}

l <- levels(f)
print(l)

```
The vector f has 15 levels.
